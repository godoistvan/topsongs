This is my 2nd datascience project with a dataset that i found on kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arnavvvvv/spotify-music/data
I used https://www.kaggle.com/code/hainescity/top-spotify-songs-cleaning-and-eda/notebook to  clean up the dataset, other than that every line of code is my own
In the first part i visualized the columns in the dataset
![basicdata](https://github.com/godoistvan/topsongs/assets/58178031/672b114b-a2ed-465f-ab03-34629a7246f4)
After that i investigated the correlation between various data points

Then i investigated the correlation between every numeric value in the dataset
![correlation](https://github.com/godoistvan/topsongs/assets/58178031/2e1486b9-afa8-4b9b-828c-f5b121289ad8)
After that i created a graph ranking the artists by most top songs

And finally i took a look at the months and found out that most hit songs are published either in january or in the mid-spring season

I also found out that most of the songs currently being streamed were published after 2020 with very few old songs still being streamed
